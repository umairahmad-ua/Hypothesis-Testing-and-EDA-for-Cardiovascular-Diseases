# Hypothesis-Testing-and-EDA-for-Cardiovascular-Diseases
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure. Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioral risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity, and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies. People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or already established disease) need early detection and management. we answered the following questions by using hypothesis testing. None of the questions can be answered as Yes or No. we are prepared a setup and run the experiments to reach a conclusion. Ensure that our conclusions are sound by keeping in mind the Dos and Don'ts for each concept. All the intermediate steps, graphs, and experimental results must be included while answering.
